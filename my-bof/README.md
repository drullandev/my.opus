This project was created for the Trivago challenge by David Rullán Díaz

- There is a run.sh file, but you can run "composer install", because the comands were setted by composer post-install-cmd

- 'Run' generate the entire Reviews ratings

- 'Import' is used to upload the 'reviews.csv' content

Thanks for testing! ;)
